## 🎉 Status Final: TODAS AS FASES COMPLETAS
**45 testes, todos passando (100% success rate)**

## TailwindCSS v4 Setup ✅
- **Package**: `django-tailwind-4[reload]` (v4-specific fork)
- **Auto-reload**: django-browser-reload integration
- **Single command**: `python manage.py tailwind dev` (runs Django + Tailwind watcher)
- **Theme app**: Created via `python manage.py tailwind init`
- **v4 syntax**: `@import "tailwindcss"`, `@theme` directive, `@source` paths
- **CSS source**: `theme/static_src/src/styles.css`
- **Output**: `theme/static/css/dist/styles.css`
- **Template tag**: `{% tailwind_css %}`
- **Custom eco theme**: Green color scheme (#10b981, #059669, #047857)
- **See**: `TAILWIND_SETUP.md` for complete guide

## Database Seeding ✅
- **Library**: Faker (pt_BR locale)
- **Command structure**: Separate per model for granular control
- **Mode**: Append-only (no data clearing)
- **Dataset size**: Medium (20-50 records per model)

### Available Commands
1. **`python manage.py seed_users`** - Creates 35 users by default
   - 60% COMPANY (with balance, company_name, CNPJ)
   - 35% PRODUCER (with farm_name, CPF)
   - 5% ADMIN (superuser)
   - Custom count: `--count N`

2. **`python manage.py seed_credits`** - Creates 45 credits by default
   - Assigned to random PRODUCER users
   - Brazilian regions (Amazônia, Cerrado, Pantanal, etc.)
   - Generation dates: past 2 years
   - Status: 60% AVAILABLE, 30% LISTED, 10% SOLD
   - 80% verified by admin

3. **`python manage.py seed_listings`** - Creates 30 listings by default
   - Only for AVAILABLE/LISTED credits
   - Price: R$50-200/ton
   - 80% with expiration date (30-180 days ahead)
   - 90% active
   - Updates credit status to LISTED

4. **`python manage.py seed_transactions`** - Creates 35 transactions by default
   - Buyer: random COMPANY users
   - Seller: credit owner (PRODUCER)
   - Status: 40% PENDING, 50% COMPLETED, 10% CANCELLED
   - Timestamp: past 6 months
   - COMPLETED transactions transfer ownership

### Usage
```bash
# Seed all data (run in order)
python manage.py seed_users
python manage.py seed_credits
python manage.py seed_listings
python manage.py seed_transactions

# Custom counts
python manage.py seed_users --count 50
python manage.py seed_credits --count 100

# Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt  # installs Faker==33.1.0
```

## Real-Time Features ✅
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** for public transactions feed
  - Endpoint: `/transactions/public/stream/`
  - One-way server push (efficient for this use case)
  - Immediate connection confirmation (triggers "Live" status quickly)
  - Heartbeat every 30s to keep connection alive
  - DB polling every 2s for new COMPLETED transactions
  - **Session-based reconnection system**:
    - Server generates UUID session ID on first connection
    - Client stores session ID in localStorage (60s validity)
    - Reconnections with valid session bypass rate limit
    - Server validates session ID + IP match
    - Session auto-refreshed every 10s on both client and server
    - Auto-cleanup: localStorage cleared when user leaves (not refresh)
  - Smart rate limiting: 5s initial timeout, refreshed to 30s every 10s while active
  - Auto-reconnect on disconnect (3s cooldown prevents spam)
  - Connection status indicator in UI
  - Anonymized data: only roles, no personal info

## Security Considerations
- CSRF protection (Django default)
- Password validation
- Role-based view access
- SQL injection protection (Django ORM)
- XSS protection (template escaping)
- Environment variables for secrets
- Rate limiting on SSE endpoint (1 connection per IP)
- Data anonymization on public endpoints

## Future Enhancements (out of scope)
- Payment gateway integration
- Credit verification system
- Advanced analytics
- Export reports (PDF/CSV)
- Email notifications
- Mobile responsive optimization
- Multi-language support

## Unresolved Questions

1. Payment integration needed now or later?
2. Credit verification/approval process by admin?
3. Max credits per listing? Min purchase amount?
4. User email verification required?
5. Allow partial credit purchases or full listing only?
6. Credit expiration dates needed?
7. Transaction cancellation/refund flow?
8. Dashboard metrics: last 30 days or all time?
